ðŸ“„ Paper: Consistent PINN Accuracy via Alternating Easy-Hard Training

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
We propose a new training strategy for Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) that alternates between easy and hard samples during training to improve accuracy and stability.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```
