ðŸ“„ Paper: Consistent PINN Accuracy via Alternating Easy-Hard Training

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
We propose a new training strategy for Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) that alternates between easy and hard samples during training to improve accuracy and stability.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

pip install -r requirements.txt

# Heat (Steep gradient)
- Visualization of a source term at $ \alpha=0.11 $ used in the heat conduction equation.
- **Left:** 3D surface of the source term $f(x,t)$, exhibiting sharp localized peaks and steep gradients, with value ranges exceeding $10^5$.
- **Right:** 1D slice of $f(x,t)$ along $x = 0$, showing highly nontrivial temporal behavior.
- Such source terms introduce strong local features and multiscale variations in the solution, posing significant challenges for standard PINNs to learn effectively.
